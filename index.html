      <h3 style="padding-top: 30px">Research</h3>
      <p>I am interested in cities as spatially and geometrically constrained complex systems. I explore how spatial and socio-economic processes interact, and how these interactions lead to morphological transformations and scaling. I like to think with data-driven analytics as well as physics-driven models. I am also interested in the structure and behavior of  complex systems in the engineering and biological domains.</p>
