      <h3 style="padding-top: 30px">Research</h3>
      <p>I am an Associate Professor in Urban Science at the School of Architecture, Design, and Planning at the University of Sydney. I conceptualise cities and urban systems as complex physical-spatial systems, and employ interdisciplinary quantitative methods from physics, geography, economics, and computer science/applied mathematics to model and empirically investigate urban form, growth, and related socio-economic impacts. I am interested in cities as spatially and geometrically constrained complex systems. I explore how the interactions and correlations between spatial/physical form and socio-economic processes lead to morphological transformations and scaling. I am especially interested in policy-sensitive socio-economic outcomes, especially spatial inequalities and urban sustainability. I am also interested in the structure and behavior of complex systems in general across many domains such as engineering and biology. The current focus of my work is to develop theory and quantiative methods to better understand urban inequalities around housing, journeys to work and jobs-housing balances, including gentrification, access to jobs and urban infrastructure, the problems of uneven
growth, spatial segregation and sorting, exclusion and displacement.</p>

      <ul>
	<li> I will be presenting in the <a href="http://urbanmodseminar.nl/" target="_blank">Urban Models Seminar Series</a>, being organised by TU Delft Urbanism, where a group of researchers comes together to explore the history and influence of various urban, geographic, and economic models on the policy and practice of urban design and planning.  
        <li>AHURI Project on <a href="https://www.ahuri.edu.au/housing/research-in-progress/measuring-neighbourhood-change-through-residential-mobility-and-employment" target="_blank"> Measuring Neighbourhood Change through Residential Mobility and Employment </a>. The project will draw on internal migration and journey-to-work data from the 2011 and 2016 Census to compute indices of neighbourhood change, identifying and focussing on deprived/affluent neighbourhoods based on residential mobility and employment connectivity. It will use this neighbourhood-change index to develop a neighbourhood-level measure of housing displacement/exclusion. </li>

     <h3 style="padding-top: 30px">Completed Research Projects</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>AHURI Stand-Alone Project on New housing supply, population growth, and access to social infrastructure: This project developed a monitoring framework, to assist as a policy coordination tool, which correlates the development of new residential supply and potential population growth against the delivery, spatial density/distributions of, and accessibility to social infrastructure, based on case studies of greenfield development sites across Sydney, Brisbane and Perth. The Project Final Report is now published <a href="https://www.ahuri.edu.au/research/final-reports/356?utm_source=website&utm_medium=homepage&utm_campaign=featurepanel" target="_blank"> here</a>. </li>
