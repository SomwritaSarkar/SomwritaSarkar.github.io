       <h2>Ongoing Research Projects, Engagements and Collaborations</h2>
      <ul>
  <li> I will be presenting in the <a href="http://urbanmodseminar.nl/" target="_blank">Urban Models Seminar Series</a>, being organised by TU Delft Urbanism, where a group of researchers comes together to explore the history and influence of various urban, geographic, and economic models on the policy and practice of urban design and planning.  
        <li>AHURI Project on <a href="https://www.ahuri.edu.au/housing/research-in-progress/measuring-neighbourhood-change-through-residential-mobility-and-employment" target="_blank"> Measuring Neighbourhood Change through Residential Mobility and Employment </a>. The project will draw on internal migration and journey-to-work data from the 2011 and 2016 Census to compute indices of neighbourhood change, identifying and focussing on deprived/affluent neighbourhoods based on residential mobility and employment connectivity. It will use this neighbourhood-change index to develop a neighbourhood-level measure of housing displacement/exclusion. </li>
      </ul>
       
     <h2>Completed Research Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>AHURI Stand-Alone Project on New housing supply, population growth, and access to social infrastructure: This project developed a monitoring framework, to assist as a policy coordination tool, which correlates the development of new residential supply and potential population growth against the delivery, spatial density/distributions of, and accessibility to social infrastructure, based on case studies of greenfield development sites across Sydney, Brisbane and Perth. The Project Final Report is now published <a href="https://www.ahuri.edu.au/research/final-reports/356?utm_source=website&utm_medium=homepage&utm_campaign=featurepanel" target="_blank"> here</a>. </li>
